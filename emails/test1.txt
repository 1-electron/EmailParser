Hi Vincent,

Happy New Years!

We met a while back regarding MediVis, the next-gen medical visualization company. I wished to followup with you regarding key company updates. We've started our clinical research trials. We've also established partnerships with Microsoft and Magic Leap. I understand Samsung also has potential plans for AR based tech development.  

We're actively engaged in the seed-stage funding round now. Would love to speak to you further when you have a chance! Attached is our deck. 

Best regards,
